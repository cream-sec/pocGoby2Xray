  description: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw was found in mod_proxy of
    httpd. This flaw allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to make the httpd server
    forward requests to an arbitrary server. The attacker could get, modify, or delete
    resources on other services that may be behind a firewall and inaccessible otherwise.
    The impact of this flaw varies based on what services and resources are available
    on the httpd network.
