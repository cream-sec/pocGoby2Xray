  description: Apache Kylinâ„¢ is an open source, distributed Analytical Data Warehouse
    for Big Data; it was designed to provide OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) capability
    in the big data era. By renovating the multi-dimensional cube and precalculation
    technology on Hadoop and Spark, Kylin is able to achieve near constant query speed
    regardless of the ever-growing data volume. Reducing query latency from minutes
    to sub-second, Kylin brings online analytics back to big data.
