  description: 'Unauthenticated remote code execution occurs in D-Link products such
    as DIR-655C, DIR-866L, DIR-652, and DHP-1565. The issue occurs when the attacker
    sends an arbitrary input to a "PingTest" device common gateway interface that
    could lead to common injection. An attacker who successfully triggers the command
    injection could achieve full system compromise. Later, it was independently found
    that these are also affected: DIR-855L, DAP-1533, DIR-862L, DIR-615, DIR-835,
    and DIR-825.'
