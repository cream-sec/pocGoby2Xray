  description: There is an unauthorized access vulnerability in JIRA. Unauthorized
    users can directly query the existence of a user name through an API interface.
    This interface is different from cve-2019-8446 and cve-2019-3403. It is a new
    interface. If JIRA is exposed to the public network, unauthorized users can directly
    access the interface
