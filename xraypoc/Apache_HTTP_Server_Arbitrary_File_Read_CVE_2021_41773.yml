  description: A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP
    Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files
    outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside
    of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require
    all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these
    aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known
    to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier
    versions.
