  description: WebSVN offers a view onto your subversion repositories that's been
    designed to reflect the Subversion methodology. You can view the log of any file
    or directory and see a list of all the files changed, added or deleted in any
    given revision. You can also view the differences between two versions of a file
    so as to see exactly what was changed in a particular revision.
